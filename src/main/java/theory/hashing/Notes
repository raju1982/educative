Hashset -> contains(search), add and remove are constant time 0(1) [on average]
        -> size, isEmpty()  are constant time 0(1) in worst case

HashMap ->
put, containsKey, remove are constant time 0(1) [on average]
get is also constant time 0(1)
size, isEmpty()  are constant time 0(1) in worst case
