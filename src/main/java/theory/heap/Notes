Binary heap is a completed Binary tree. They are stored as an array (without any gaps, with proper parent child relationship.)
left child(i) = 2i+1
right child(i) = 2i+2
Parent (i)  = (i-1)/2

Min heap :-
complete binary tree
every node has value small than it's descendants.
stored as an array

Arrays.sort -> O(n log n)
Insertion [add()]/remove [Poll()]: It has O(log(n)) time complexity.
peek() min/max, size(): It has O(1) time complexity.
Search/contains(Object) :      O(N)

1. Sort an array that is already k-sorted.
2. Buying the maximum items with a given sum.
3. Calculate the K Largest Elements in an unsorted array
4. K Closest Elements       **** [do this again and again]
5. Merge K Sorted Arrays    **** [do this again and again]
6. Find Median of a Stream
Educative.io
Design a class to calculate the median of a number stream. The class should have the following two methods:
insertNum(int num): stores the number in the class
findMedian(): returns the median of all numbers inserted in the class

7.Given an array of numbers and a number ‘k’, find the median of all the ‘k’ sized sub-arrays (or windows) of the array.
