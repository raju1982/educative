A Graph is a data structure that consists of the following two components:
A finite set of vertices also called nodes.
A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge.
The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not the same as (v, u) in case of a directed graph(digraph).
The pair of the form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v.
The edges may contain weight/value/cost.


Breadth First Search -
O(V+E)

undirected graph represent a social network.
using BFS we can print all people that can be reached using a person (vertex) through any number of friends, basically the network.
using BFS we can print the network in an ordered way. first your connection then your connections connections.

Webcrawler is a very important application of the Breadth-First Search Algorithm.
The idea is that the whole internet can be represented by a directed graph:
with vertices -> Domains/ URLs/ Websites.
edges -> Connections.

1. Shortest path in an undirected graph
2. Webcrawler in search engine
3. Peer to Peer network (bittorrent) [search among your neighbors and then their neighbors]
4. Social networking search (searching for a person, first name of person who is your friend and then who is your friends friends)
5. In garbage collection (????)
6. Cycle detection in undirected and directed graph
7. Ford Fulkerson algorithm
8. Broadcasting


Application of Depth First Search -
O(V+E)

1. Cycle detection (directed graph)
2. Topological sorting
3. Strongly connected components
4. Solving maze and similar puzzle
5. Path finding

1. Prim's Algorithm/Minimum Spanning Tree [weighted, undirected, connected graph]
A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a weighted, undirected, connected graph whose total edge weight has been minimized by removing heavier edges.
2. Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted, undirected/directed graph, may contain cycle) []
