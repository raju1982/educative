Binary search tree -
extremely fast lookup of specific value and insertion of new node

tree to array ->
 in-order traversal on the tree to get a sorted array which is in ascending order.
 use String builder -> stringbuilder.tostring.split -> ascending order array




BINARY SEARCH TREES ARE TYPICALLY USED FOR FAST INSERTION AND FAST LOOKUP

IN A TREE WHEN A NEW NODE IS ADDED THERE IS EXACTLY ONE PLACE THAT IT CAN BE THE STRUCTURE OF A TREE DEPENDS ON THE ORDER IN WHICH THE NODES ARE ADDED INSERTION

WHILE SEARCHING FOR A NODE IN THE TREE THERE IS ONLY ONE PLACE WHERE THAT NODE CAN BE FOUND WE CAN SIMPLY FOLLOW THE RIGHT OR LEFT SUB-TREES BASED ON THE VALUE WE WANT TO FIND LOOKUP
