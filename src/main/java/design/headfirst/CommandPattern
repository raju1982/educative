Command Object- a command object separates the execution of an action from the action itself.
The receiver - receives the action
The Invoker - Invokes the action
The client - The users who Triggers the execution of the action


element triggers notification -> observer pattern
in UI programming command pattern and observer pattern are used heavily.

thread example -
defining the command object  - Wrap action in the body of an object that implements an interface with just one method -> callable, runnable
The Invoker - we then ask that this object "do its thing" on a separate thread. - thread.start
