Hashing is a technique -> O(1) average time to search, insert or delete elements.

Avoid hashing if ->
find closest value (AVL or read/black tree)
sorted data (AVL or read/black tree)
prefix search (Trie)


hashing implementation ->
dictionary
database indexing
cryptography
caches
router
getting data from database


hash function characteristic ->
1. should be able to handle various type of key (large integer, float, string)
2. should generate value form 0 to n-1. n is the size of the data structure.
3. should uniformly distribute the keys
4. should be fast O(1) for integer and O(len) for string with length len
