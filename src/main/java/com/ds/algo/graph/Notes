1. AdjacencyListUndirectedGraphRepresentation
2  BFSUndirectedGraph - it is assumed that all vertices are reachable from the starting vertex.
                     But in the case of disconnected graph or any vertex that is unreachable from all vertex,
3. BFSForDisconnectedUndirectedGraph
BFS - time complexity - O(no.OfVertcies+no.OFEdge)  ******
4. NumberOfConnectedComponentsInUndirectedGraph

BFS applications ->
    shortest path in an unweighted graph
    cycle detection
    ford fulkerson algorithm
    crawler in search engine
    social networking search


5. DepthFirstSearchInUndirectedGraph
6. DepthFirstSearchInDisconnectedUndirectedGraph

DFS - time complexity - O(no.OfVertcies+no.OFEdge)  *******

DFS applications ->
    cycle detection
    Topological sorting (maven file checking depdencies***)
    Path finding (source to destination)
    solving Maze and similar puzzle.  (backtracking is based on DFS)
    strongly connected components.
