stack -             push, pop, peek, contains, size, isEmpty
queue (linklist) -  offer,poll,peek, contains, size, isempty


stack applications -
functional call
balance parentheses
reverse items
undo/redo operation


An ArrayDeque (also known as an “Array Double Ended Queue”, pronounced as “ArrayDeck”) is a special kind of a growable array that allows us to add or remove an element from both sides.
An ArrayDeque implementation can be used as a Stack (Last-In-First-Out) or a Queue(First-In-First-Out).

ArrayDeque ->
stack -> push, pop, peekLast, size, isEmpty, contains   -> time complexity 0(1)
queue -> offer,poll,peek, size, isEmpty, contains
