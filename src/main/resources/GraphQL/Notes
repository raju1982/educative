edX LinuxFoundationX: LFS141x	Exploring GraphQL: A Query Language for APIs

GraphQL is a new API standard that provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST (Representational State Transfer).
At its core, GraphQL enables declarative data fetching where a client can specify exactly what data it needs from an API.
Instead of multiple endpoints that return fixed data structures, a GraphQL server only exposes a single endpoint and responds with precisely the data that a client asked for.

REST has been a popular way to expose data from a server.
In particular there are three factors that have been challenging the way how APIs are designed.
Increased mobile usage, low-power devices and sloppy networks were the initial reasons why Facebook developed GraphQL.
GraphQL minimizes the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network and thus majorly improves applications operating under these conditions.
With REST APIs the way how data is exposed by the server often needs to be modified to account for specific requirements and design changes on the client-side.This hinders fast development practices and product iterations.
